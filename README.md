# Piezo Knock Switch

This project demonstrates how to use a piezoelectric sensor to detect mechanical vibrations (knocks) and trigger an electronic response. When a knock is detected, the circuit activates an output such as an LED or alarm using a 555 timer IC and transistor-based flip-flop logic.

## Features
- Detects knocks using a piezoelectric sensor
- Triggers an LED or alarm on each knock
- Built using 555 Timer IC and NPN transistor (BC547)
- Works on breadboard and PCB implementations

## Components
- 555 Timer IC
- BC547 NPN Transistor
- Piezo Sensor
- Resistors: 100KΩ, 10MΩ (x2), 330Ω
- Capacitor: 10uF
- LED / Output Device
- Power Supply (5-12V)

## Applications
- Knock-activated switches
- Automatic doorbell systems
- Vibration detection for security systems
- Earthquake detection devices

## How it Works
The piezoelectric sensor generates a voltage when tapped, which is amplified and processed by the circuit to toggle the output state via the 555 timer IC.
